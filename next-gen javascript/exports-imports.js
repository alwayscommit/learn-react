/*
We can import content from another file

There are default and named exports
default exports can be imported using any name
named exports can be imported using that specific export name within {}
named exports can also be assigned an alias.

import {person as p} from './person.js';

multiple named exports can be imported as *

import * as bundled from './utility.js';

 Q1. Can we have more than one default export?
